\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we provide a theoretical review of measurement-based quantum computing. We provide the definition and essential properties of graph states essential to measurement-based quantum computing. Using these mathematical objects, we define a cluster and build an abstract machine called a one-way quantum computer on top of it. We show how this machine can be used to perform universal quantum computation. In order to prove this, we define a procedure for simulating any circuit-based quantum algorithm using the one-way computer up to a unitary transformation, composed of Pauli x and z operations, called the by-product operator. Lastly, we provide  Deutsch's algorithm as an example to demonstrate this procedure. Our simulation outcomes using Paddle Quantum show that the procedure indeed works.
