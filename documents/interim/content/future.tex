\section{Future Outlook}

In the following weeks, we will complete work package two by providing the procedure for doing universal computation. To this end, we will introduce blueprints to simulate gates used in circuit-based quantum computation, which is proven to be Turing complete. Then we are going to move along with the discussion of various algorithms formulated for this paradigm. We will also seek to find circuit-based counterparts for these measurement-based algorithms and compare their overall performance and resource usage. We will also focus more of our attention on preparing the project poster and final report as their respective deadlines are also approaching.
